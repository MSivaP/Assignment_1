Commannd : git tag -a <Version number> -m <some content>

How to delete the tag 	
Command : git tag –d <tag name>

How to check the server connected to remote repository.
Command : git remote –v

How to add the repository in local server.
Step 1: Login the git and create the repository 
Step 2: Copy the push existing url in git.
 
Step 3: Login to the local server and check the existing repository.
Command : git remote –v
Step 4: Add the repository in local server using below command.
Command : 
git remote add <alias name> <url> 
Ex : 
git remote add origin https://github.com/MSivaP/Todayproject_05042023.git
 
Step 5: After adding repository in local server we need to change the branch name 
Command : git branch –M <branch Name>
Ex : git branch –M main

How to push local project data in repository.
Here : repository alias name is : origin   Branch Name is : main

Step 1: check the repository name and branch name in local server.
Command : git remote –v     ========> checking the repository alias name
Command : git branch       ========> checking the branch name 
Step 2: Push the data into repository and use below command.
Command : git push –u <alias name of repository> <Branch Name>
Here we will user name and password(token value need to enter) 
Ex : 
 

How to push tags local to repository?
Here : 
Repository alias name is : origin
Branch Name is : main
Step 1: Login to the local server(Machine)
Step 2: Run below command 
Command : git push –u <alias name> <branch name> --tags
Ex :  

How to push the data without password less in git.

git config --global credential.helper store

Enter the password one time  

How to pull the repository data into the new developer server?
For the first time need to pull use clone command.
Command : git clone <repository Url>


What is fork and clone
Fork : It is a copy in remote server from my account to another account
Clone : It is a copy of our project from remote server to local server.


For the first time getting the code to the developer need use clone command the local server
git clone <URL>
Ex : git clone https://github.com/MSivaP/Assignment_1.git


--------------------------
DEV1
--------------------------
Dev 1 added new file in the project 
touch dev1.txt
-------------------------
DEV2 
-------------------------
Dev2 added new file in the project
touch dev2.txt

First DEV1 pushed the code in repositery then DEV2 need to pull the code after words DEV2 to push the code into repositery.













What is difference git fetch and git pull.
Git fetch only update in the .git references
Git pull will update the changes local changes and git references.
What is branch and to check all the branches in remote as well local.
In Git, a branch is a new/separate version of the main repository.
git branch  ===== > to show only local branches
git branch –r ==== > to show all remote branches
git branch <branch name> ==== > create the branch in the local server.
git checkout –b <branch name> === > create the branch name and switch to that branch 
Ex : git checkout –b test_2 ==== > to create the test_2 branch and switch test_2 branch.
git branch –d <branch name> ==== > To delete the branch 
Note : current running we can delete some other we can delete
git branch –D <branch name> ==== > to delete the branch forcefully















Build code : converting the source into the deployable / installable format.
We can not use the source code .We need to convert the source into build code.
How to Build code : We have  build tools.
Java --- Maven/ant/gradle
.net  -- ms build
Python – pybuild




What are the various steps/stages involved in build code process?
i.	Mvn compile --- > Converting the high level lan to machine level language
ii.	Mvn code review -- > validating the code and check the mistakes in the code.
iii.	Mvn unittest -- > individual code testing (classes,functions) tested by developer.
iv.	Mvn code coverage --- > % to code coverage under testing.
v.	Mvn package  -- > In this level source code convert the deployable or installable format.

Who perform the build code stages  Build tools like mvn, perform the above stages.
Automate the above the thing with help of Jenkins :
Jenkins tool can help to automate the build code process
Jenkins is known as build code process / Continuous integration server.
Build code process called as continuous integration process (CI process)
PIPE LINE :
If run the above stages in build codes process in sequence order without manual intervention then it call as PIPE LINE.
Build code process === Continuous Integration process =  CI PIPE LINE
